# Fixing Asset Paths for Local Development

When working on a web project locally, you might encounter issues where images or fonts fail to load. This often happens because the asset paths in the code include a prefix specific to the production environment, such as `/eclipse-enigma`.

## Problem

In production, asset paths might look like this in your `.css` file:

### Example

```Font
src: url(/eclipse-enigma/fonts/iosevkanerdfontmono.ttf) format("truetype");
```

These paths work in production but fail on a local system because the `/eclipse-enigma` prefix doesn't exist in the local environment.

## Solution

To fix this issue, **remove the `/eclipse-enigma` prefix** and use relative paths instead.

### Updated Code
```Font
src: url(/fonts/iosevkanerdfontmono.ttf) format("truetype");
```


## Benefits of Using Relative Paths
1. **Local Compatibility**: Assets will load correctly on your local system.
2. **Cross-Environment Consistency**: The project will work seamlessly in both local and production environments.
3. **Simpler Maintenance**: Relative paths are easier to manage during development and deployment.

## Implementation Steps
1. Open your `.css` file.
2. Search for paths containing `/eclipse-enigma` (or any other production-specific prefix).
3. Replace these paths with relative paths starting from the project root or relevant directory.

### Before
```Font
src: url(/eclipse-enigma/fonts/iosevkanerdfontmono.ttf) format("truetype");
```

### After
```Font
src: url(/fonts/iosevkanerdfontmono.ttf) format("truetype");
```

By making these adjustments, your project will be ready for local development without breaking asset loading functionality.
```

This is structured for a clear and professional GitHub `README.md` file and uses Markdown conventions effectively.
